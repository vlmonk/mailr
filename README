Installation

   1. Checkout the source code
   2. If you need to override some of the default constants used in the application take a look at config/default_site.rb. Then create config/site.rb that contains only the keys which you want to override. Example content of config/site.rb is:

   module CDF

   LOCALCONFIG = {
     :imap_server => 'your.imap.server'
   }            
   end
